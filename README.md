# World Happiness Survey and Global Temperature Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the World Happiness Survey dataset and incorporates the Global Temperature by Country dataset. The analysis provides insights into global happiness levels and the relationship between happiness and temperature.

## Datasets

The analysis utilizes the following datasets:

- World Happiness Survey: The World Happiness Survey dataset contains information about happiness scores and various factors such as economic, social, and health indicators. It includes data from multiple countries over different years.
- Global Temperature by Country: The Global Temperature by Country dataset provides historical temperature data for different countries. It includes temperature records over time, allowing for analysis of the relationship between temperature and happiness.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository covers the following analysis steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Load the World Happiness Survey and Global Temperature datasets and perform initial data exploration.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, merge the datasets based on country and year.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the relationships between happiness scores, factors influencing happiness, and global temperature.
4. Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests and analysis to investigate the significance of variables and their impact on happiness scores.
5. Visualization: Visualize the data using various charts, plots, and maps to effectively communicate the findings.
6. Conclusion and Insights: Summarize the key findings, insights, and conclusions derived from the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`World_Happiness_Temperature.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.
4. Review the analysis results, findings, and insights presented in the notebook.
